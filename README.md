# Concept #

This was a lot of fun as you can tell :)
I went overkill with design and details but it's not only form, the layout and svg 
animations made me learn a lot about bundling and dom manipulation.
Webpack can be very daunting but the pleasure of bundling js modules makes it a blast.


# Modular logic #

There are a total of 6 js modules, 3 for the content of each page, one for the general
layout, one to handle the tab navigation (the content is removed and recreated each time 
just right after the page slide animation). The last one is index.js module that acts like
a proper app controller module.


# Visual and ux #

Hope you'll have a little fun looking at this.
The design is totally not responsive, i wanted to deliver this sassy look but make it responsive 
(although quite possible, i'm thinking at grid template areas..) would have taken too much time.
The beautiful icons for the menu and contact page are from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/onigiri" title="onigiri icons">Japan icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a>
The logo, hours board and all the animations are custom made for the project by myself.
